#### IBM Carrier Education Program, Project No: 328726

Storage Space Tracker is a Dynamic Web Application that monitors and updates 
the space allocation of any storage unit in real-time. In this project, the Storage 
Space Tracker is implemented in and as Warehouse Space Management when 
can allocate, update and delete space in real-time web application. And also calculates how much space can be allocated further or how much is free for allocation.

In real-life, managing and maintaining a physical warehouse is a tough job.Moreover, in logistics warehouses (be that Government or Private), the rate of corruption is very high due to manual documentation. The number of human error is very high due to missing documentation and mishandling of files. Storage Space Tracker can take care of those using an online database, storing all the data separately and also calculating in real-time. Since India is getting digitized and every information is digitally available, this should add more perspective towards digitized India.

The customer can arrange the space needed by the help of only few clicks. Online payment system takes care of huge transaction problems. The customers can also upgrade their space, extend and also monitor the warehouse using just a web browser while the managers can keep an eye at all the activity happening at the warehouse at a glance.

## 1. INTRODUCTION:

### 1.1 Objective:

The main objective of Storage Space Tracker is to calculate the storage space of a warehouse such a way that it can check, manage and handle the shipment of goods in warehouse automatically without any human interaction by using automated calculations where necessary. 

The client is a carrying and forwarding (C&F) agent with a warehouse, where the manufactured / shipped goods of various multinational companies are stored before they are sent to the wholesale market. Due to increase in customers, it has become difficult for the client to manually manage the warehouse space and ensure that there is no loss of business. The system can manage the warehouse space smartly and ensure that there is no unused vacant space.

### 1.2 Project Scope

The new system will focus on tracking storage space of a warehouse automatically without any human interaction. It will check for how much space is occupied in the warehouse, how much space is left to use, which shipments will arrive when, how much space to allocate when it arrives, which shipments to depart when and how much space will be freed when it leaves without any human interactions. It will generate a full report automatically and mail it to responsible employees so that they can keep an eye in this matter. Thus, making it more feasible to handle big warehouses automatically and without any human interactions at a very low maintenance budget. The user interface of this web application is very easy to use and a unique visual mapping feature will help even a non-technical person to use this system efficiently. The system that the client needs should be able to manage the warehouse space smartly and ensure that there is no loss in business by keeping spaces vacant.

### 1.3 Targeted Audience:

Storage Space Tracker is utilized for an array of situations, and that means a wide variety of different customers will visit this facility each day. It’s important to consider which groups of people use storage most and which features those prospective tenants look for. Here, four profiles are specifically implemented for the most common renters in warehouse storage and which particular amenities best service their needs. An evaluation of these profiles can benefit owners in regards to decisions concerning marketing, operations, property development and more.

* Carry – Forward agents
* E-commerce owners & sellers
* Govt. Agencies (Example: Food Corporation of India)
* Farmhouses

### 1.4 Solution

The Storage Space Tracker can automatically allocate and update both space and price of that particular warehouses where-as in real-life, managing and maintaining a physical warehouse is a tough job. Moreover, in logistics warehouses (be that Government or Private), the rate of corruption is very high due to manual documentation. The number of human error is very high due to missing documentation and mishandling of files. Storage Space Tracker can take care of those using an online database, storing all the data separately and also calculating in realtime. Since India is getting digitized and every information is digitally available, this should add more perspective towards digitized India. The customer can arrange the space needed by the help of only few clicks. Online payment system takes care of huge transaction problems. The customers can also upgrade their space, extend and also monitor the warehouse using just a web browser while the managers can keep an eye at all the activity happening at the warehouse at a glance.

### 1.5 Users of the system:

There are four types of users in the system specifically allotted for some specific tasks as follows:
* Customer
* Warehouse Managers
* System Admin

**Customers:** The customers can sign-up with valid E-mail ID or mobile number. Only one account will be given per customer. Using that account, the customer can buy spaces as per his/her requirements. The customer can also update space allocation in case he/she needs more space. Every customer will be given one unique system generated User ID to identify them uniquely and a system generated password to safeguard their accounts. The customer can remove the spaces he/she needs at any time before validity but however no refunds will can be given in that case. Moreover, the customers can interact with warehouse managers through a chat portal, report certain events and there is a live feed of CCTV camera monitoring his logistics 24*7 hours.

**Warehouse Managers:** The main role of the Warehouse Managers is to monitor and supervise the whole warehouse. They can check which user is using how much of space, when that particular space will be freed, how much space left in the warehouse in total. They can interact with the customers using a chat portal. They can also revue the transactions and calculate the total revenue.

**System Admin:** The System Administrator is responsible for keeping the system up & running 24*7 hours. They keep an eye on the server configuration, sessions generated and periodical maintenance. They also keep an eye on the different databases; modifying or removing any particular entry if needed.

### 1.6 Unique Selling Proposition:

A unique selling proposition (USP, also seen as unique selling point) is a factor that differentiates a product from its competitors, such as the lowest cost, the highest quality or the first-ever product of its kind. A USP could be thought of as *“what you have that competitors don’t.”*

A successful USP promises a clearly articulated benefit to consumers, offers them something that competitive products can’t or don’t offer, and is compelling enough to attract new 
customers.

Some USPs taken for this project as follows:

* **BIGGER SPACE:** Storage Space Tracker Warehouse is operating on 22 acres of Warehousing complex in Jaipur with a storage capacity of  thousand tones which is one of the largest 
warehousing complex in India.
* **LOWEST PRICE GURANTEED:** Logistics which keeps your wallet happy & healthy ;)
* **24*7 Surveillance System:** Your goods' security is our top-most priority. Advanced security & proximity alarm will never let any trespassers to housebreak.
* **Advanced Fire Breakout Prevention:** We got top-grade sprinkler system & militarygrade fire-extinguishers to prevent any kind of incineration.
* **Convenient Transportation:** Located right beside NH-52. Only 5KM away from Jaipur Railway Station & 15KM away from Jaipur Airport.
